# Witch-Animation
In this project, one of the main goals was creating animations through top-down design. 
To do so, we used the Zelleâ€™s Graphics Module to create objects such as a rectangle, circle, polygon, and more. 
By creating various shapes, we were able to combine them to form a complex object and therefore make a whole animated scene.
